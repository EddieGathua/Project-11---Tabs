        <p>
          When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
          people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
          another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and
          equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle
          them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
          should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

              <p>
                We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are
                created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
                certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty
                and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights,
                Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers
                from the consent of the governed,
              </p>

            <div class="content" id="vision">
              <h4>Vision</h4>
              <p>
                That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
                these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish
                it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on
                such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to
                them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness
              </p>

            <div class="content" id="goals">
              <h4>Goals</h4>
              <p>
                Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established
                should not be changed for light and transient causes; and
                accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more
                disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right
                themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
